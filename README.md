# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This project in the Technigo bootcamp was to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API. The purpose was to learn what an API is and how to use it.

Tech:
<br>JavaScript(ES6), HTML, CSS</br>

I used JavaScript, fetching data from Open Weather Map working with the Date() object. I fetched data for the weather in four cities that the user could choose between. The app displayed the min and max temperature for each each weekday and the current temperature.
